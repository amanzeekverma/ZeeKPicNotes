ZEEK PIC NOTES
=============
Android App

Idea of the app is to take notes/pics but not clutter the phone's album where you keep important family/events pictures. The study/work notes/ to-do tasks / quick contact snap/ whiteboard pic should be at a separate location instead of being at the sharing the same family space.


A Simple App, makes use of:
1. Camera2 services
2. Takes pictures and save it (1024X768) to one of the selected albums in personal gallery

Email bugs : avD.ZeeK@gmail.com

App Version : 1

NEGATIVES:
* Hard coded 4 location currently exists.
* Does not ask to "CONFIRM" and just keeps on saving pic/snaps

Next Big Sprint:
* Fix Negatives
* Dynamically add new albums from UI.
* Display existing albums on the phone.
